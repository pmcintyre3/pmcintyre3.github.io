# A* Algorithm
### Author: Phillip McIntyre

## Criteria

* Constructed using HTML5/JavaScript/Canvas

* Displays Default Map

* F, G, and H toggle display pressing 'A' key

* Final Path drawn after it reaches the end

* Simulates the entire algorithm by pressing 'D' key

* Step through algorithm using 'S' key

* Grid can have as many as the user desires. Quality 
degenerates at around 50 x 50

* Grid is entirely customizable

* Click blank spaces to add obstacles. Click obstacles 
to remove them

* Click goal space to remove it. Click a blank space 
to add the goal space to the map

* Click start space to remove it. Click a blank space
to add the start space to the map

* Two text boxes are available on the right to 
change the row and column dimensions

* A star finds the most optimal path according to the
Heuristic option given. If the Heuristic does not overestimate
the cost of reaching the goal, it may not be able to determine
the optimal path.

* A* uses a Heuristic to determine a more optimal path. Without
the Heuristic to aid in finding more relevant paths (or, if
for every node, h(x) = 0), it becomes equivalent to Dijkstra's 
Algorithm.

## Embellishments

* Node width/height adjusts depending on number of rows and
columns and border width.

* Added Dijkstra's Algorithm in

* Built in HTML5/JavaScript/Canvas
